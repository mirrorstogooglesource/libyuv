      "message": "Thanks for highlighting! In future I would prefer we didn\u0027t hide such changes in an AVX512 changeset so we actually have visibility of them more easily, and preferably also with a commit message that actually explains why the change is being made.\n\nIs there a reason this also disables SME for Linux, which I believe works fine at present?\n\nNon-Linux platforms should also be handled correctly by the recent .gni changes to restrict the enablement to just `is_linux` platforms, so I\u0027m unsure why this was needed at all really?\n\nI\u0027ll assume that Linux is fine and prepare a change to re-enable guarded by `__gnu_linux__` which should be sufficient until upstream compilers have resolved the present issues with other platforms.",
