I was sick last week and somehow missed this CL.\n\nI am not really qualified to review this change, because I don\u0027t fully understand the problem we need to solve. Here are two initial thoughts.\n\n1) I am not sure if libyuv\u0027s BUILD.gn file can assume the compiler is Clang.\n\n2) I am wondering if it is the [proposed change to build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5904093/1/build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn) that should be changed to use the Clang cc1 flag \"-target-feature\":\n\n\n```\nconfig(\"compiler_arm64_lse\") {\n  if (current_cpu \u003d\u003d \"arm64\" \u0026\u0026 aarch64_use_lse) {\n    cflags \u003d [ \"-march\u003darmv8-a+lse\" ]\n    ldflags \u003d [ \"-march\u003darmv8-a+lse\" ]\n  }\n}\n```",

      "message": "No worries, I hope you feel better!\n\nTo explain the problem at hand: \nHaving a global config that uses the \"-march\" flag overwrites the flag args set by other build files resulting in an issue.\n\nRegarding:\n1) There is a variable \"is_clang\" that is being utilized in chromium build files which we can use (since \"target-feature\" seems to be not available in other compilers).\n\n2) Initially we tried that, but it seems that using \"-march\" flag to enable LSE enforces more implicit changes to the binaries which we are hoping would bring more uplift to performance (the end-goal of this patch). Since the features in libyuv such as i8mm or dotprod are being used explicitly however using \"-march\" or \"-target-feature\" doesn\u0027t make a difference.",
