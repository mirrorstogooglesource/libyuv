      "message": "much simplier.   the 1555, 565 and 4444 formats are really not used anymore.\n2:10:10:10 is, though, so if you can do the same magic on those, that would be good.\nthe reason for AR30/AB30 is to pass off 10 bit to GPUs.  If ARM based devices have other formats, it might be nice to support.  There is a 64 bit fp16 argb format, and libyuv has AR64 support, since its trivial, but I dont think its commonly supported.\n\nneeds a rebase",
